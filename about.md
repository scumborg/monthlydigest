# About The Monthly Digest

## Project Purpose

The Monthly Digest offers concise, factual summaries of key global events without the emotional manipulation, endless scrolling, or toxic comment sections that characterize modern media consumption.

I created this project after discovering that scheduled, filtered news consumption significantly improved my mental wellbeing while keeping me adequately informed about world events.

## How It Works

1. Once monthly, I compile and summarize key world events
2. Summaries are organized by category and significance
3. Sources are cited but emotional language is minimized
4. Updates are published by the 15th of each month

## Philosophy

This project is guided by four core principles:

- **Intentional consumption** over mindless scrolling
- **Balanced awareness** over both ignorance and overexposure
- **Mental wellbeing** alongside civic engagement
- **Thoughtful distance** from the 24/7 news cycle

## Support This Project

This project is currently self-funded and provided as a free resource. If you find it valuable, consider sharing it with others who might benefit.
