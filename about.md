# About The Monthly Digest

The Monthly Digest provides essential information without the emotional manipulation, endless doom-scrolling, or toxic comment sections that characterize modern media consumption.

## Philosophy

- **Intentional consumption** over mindless scrolling
- **Balanced awareness** over both ignorance and overexposure 
- **Mental wellbeing** alongside civic engagement
- **Thoughtful distance** from the 24/7 news cycle

## How It Works

Each month, I curate a digest of significant developments across:
- Global Affairs
- Economics & Business
- Science & Environment
- Society & Culture

All summaries aim to be factual, concise, and free from unnecessary emotional language.

## About the Creator

This project was created after discovering that scheduled, filtered news consumption significantly improved mental wellbeing while maintaining adequate awareness of world events.
