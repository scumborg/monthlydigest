# The Monthly Digest

A minimalist approach to staying informed without the noise.

## About This Project

This site offers monthly AI-summarized news digests designed to provide essential information without the emotional manipulation, endless doom-scrolling, or toxic comment sections that characterize modern media consumption.

I created this project after discovering that scheduled, filtered news consumption significantly improved my mental wellbeing while keeping me adequately informed about world events.

## Philosophy

- **Intentional consumption** over mindless scrolling
- **Balanced awareness** over both ignorance and overexposure 
- **Mental wellbeing** alongside civic engagement
- **Thoughtful distance** from the 24/7 news cycle

## Latest Digest

## How It Works

1. Once monthly, I use AI to summarize key world events
2. Summaries are organized by category and significance
3. Sources are cited but emotional language is minimized
4. Updates are published by the 15th of each month
